# 🔢 Day 10: Binary Numbers | HackerRank 30 Days of Code

This repository contains the Python solution for **Day 10** of the [HackerRank 30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) challenge , which focuses on *Binary Numbers* by implementing a binary representation.

## 🚀 Challenge Summary

Given a base-10 integer `n`, convert it to binary (base-2) and determine the **maximum number of consecutive `1`s** in its binary representation.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Write a program to:

1. Convert an integer `n` to binary

2. Identify groups of consecutive `1`s

3.Output the **length** of the longest group

### ✅ Constraints:

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6

### 🔢 Sample Input

13

### ✅ Sample Output

2

### 💡 Explanation

- Binary of 13 → `1101`

- Consecutive 1's groups → `'11'`, `'1'`
  
- Maximum group length → `2`

  ## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Binary number conversion using Python's `bin()` function
  
- String manipulation and pattern recognition
  
- Use of `split()` and `max()` functions
  
- Problem-solving and control flow logic

### ✅How to Run:

Option 1: With input file Create a file named input.txt with the required input and run: python3 binary_numbers.py < input.txt

Option 2: Manual input Just run: python3 binary_numbers.py
